Adding a computer player to the game:

player = "X"
computer = "O"
turn = user

Ask the user if they want to go first
    if no:
        player = "O"
        computer = "X"
        turn = computer

if turn == user:
    Player's turn
    make move and place player
    turn = computer

else:
    Computer's turn
    make_move = remaining_spots[random.randint(0, len(remaining_spots))]
    boardgame = place_player(make_move, boardgame, computer)
